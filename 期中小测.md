1.(7p) Assume that $M\triangleleft G,N\triangleleft G$,then $G/(M\cap N)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $(G/M)\times (G/N)$.

2.(7p) Prove that a non-abelian group of order $6$ is $S_3$.

3.(8p) Prove that a non-trivial group with non-trivial subgroups must be a cyclic group with a prime order.

4.(8p) Prove that for any $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\leq 0}$, there are only finitely many mutually non-isomorphic groups of order $n$.

5.(10p) Assume that $R$ is a ring. If for any element $a\in R$, $a^2=a$ holds, then we call $R$ a $Boole\ Ring$. Prove that a $Boole\ Ring$ must be a commutative ring, and $a+a=0$ holds for any $a\in R$.

6.(10p) Assume that $G$ is a finite non-abelian simple group, and $p$ is a prime number with $p\mid \vert G\vert$. Prove that $G$ has more than one $Sylow\ p$ -subgroup.

7.(10p) Assume that $K,H$ are two subgroup of $G$, use $[K,H]$ to denote the group generated by $\{[k,h]|k\in K,h\in H\}$. Use $\langle K,H\rangle$ to denote the group generated by $K\cup H$. Try to prove that:
(1) If $H\triangleleft G$ and $H \leq K$, then $K/H\leq Z(G/H) \iff [K,G]\leq H$.
(2) $[K,H]\triangleleft \langle K,H\rangle$.

8.(10p) Assume that $p$ is a factor of the order of $G$ as $G$ is a finite group, and $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. If $p$ and $\vert G/N\vert$ are coprime, then $N$ contains all $Sylow\ p$ -subgroups of $G$.

9.(10p) Assume that $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$,and $G$ act transitively on $\Omega$, prove that under this action, all orbits of $N$ acts on $\Omega$ has the same length.

10.(10p) Find all the maximal ideals and prime ideals of ring $2\mathbb{Z}$.

11.(10p) Prove that if $R$ is a integral domain but not a field, then $R$ contains a ideal which is not a principal ideal.
